# Queues

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericduran/queues.png?branch=7.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/ericduran/queues)

So this is extremely simalar to Entity Queues. As a matter of fact the Queue Type selection
form was taken from the Entity Queue module.

Sadly we needed a different module because we want to create Queue Bundles, which a user can
have multiple off. For example, you can create a Queue called "Promo Queue". Editors can then
go and make 100 Promo Queue which different items in them.
